# Health-Care-Management-System

This project aims to make the workflow easy and effective between doctors, employees and patients in a hospital. The patients data is stored in a database. Also, the new appointments for the patients are set in an easy way by the receptionist by keeping the visit history and deleted appointment of the visiting patients. The patients are guided to the specialized doctors automatically when they tell the corresponding problem.
